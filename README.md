This is a collection of my notes for the various projects I work on. 
There's nothing specific for when or why I'll document things here; it's as much for my benefit as it is for yours, 
if not more. I intend to grow this as I work through Hack The Box projects, setup more home labs, and potentially 
when doing random projects around the house.
