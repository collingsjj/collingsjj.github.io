Capable and experienced physicist-turned-engineer, driven by a lifelong fascination with technology and computer systems. Skilled in problem analysis, solution design, and efficient implementation; building personal Linux servers has been a hobby long before it became a profession. Recently moved into the cybersecurity sphere with a newfound passion for CTFs and other Red Team activities.

When I'm not mucking about my computer, I'm usually playing games. My primary platform is Steam, though I grew up on Sega, Playstation, and Nintendo. I mostly play RPGs (Final Fantasy, etc), Action (Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, etc) or puzzle games (Hacknet, Balatro, etc).
